# Cartesian_control-height_maintain
Python scripts to enter manual xyz values to move along a cartesian path making use of ROS moveit trajectory planning and also a simple script to maintain a height  along an axis paired with ultrasonic sensor.

note:
The above code for height maintian contains coordinate values used specifically for ABB IRB120 simulation (ROS INDUSTRIAL) make changes when needed.
No roscore needed as it uses running move it roscore for message transfer.
